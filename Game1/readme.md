Change the sprite for the gold star and make it random items (like gems, mushrooms, coins).

Change the sprite for the player and make it some monster or person.

Instead of re-starting the game every time the player dies, add a death counter and simply count the deaths.

Place the death counter at the bottom right hand side of the game, using the same font as the score.

Since we never restart the game, lets add a timer to stop the game after X minutes.

Place this timer at the top right of the game and have it counting down from X in miniutes:seconds.

If the player dies (hitting a bomb) reset the score to zero.
